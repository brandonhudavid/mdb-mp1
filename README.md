# Match the Members

Welcome to Match the Members, the app that helps the plebian newbies learn the beautiful faces of MDB. The user starts by clicking the Start button. Every round, the user has 5 seconds to click on the correct member shown. Every correct click earns 1 point, while clicking a wrong name sets your score back to 0! Click on the Statistics button at the bottom to view the high score and the last 3 members that were shown on the app.
